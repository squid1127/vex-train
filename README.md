# vex-train

A code to sync vex brain motors, for a train perhaps?

The goal here is to create code that will sync multiple brains together to allow for control of way to many motors, allowing for the creation of a "train" of robots.

Right now code is setup so that we have one host and two clients. These robots are setup to sync their drivetrain.
